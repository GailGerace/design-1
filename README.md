Kitchen Design
=============



The kitchen design and style also varies depending on how you build it. There are hundreds of kitchen interior online and as I got the specific project, I used the knowledge in architectural to build a new home out of simple tools. I stumble upon on these quaint sites and would like to share some of the tools. 

The tools in this category are the Autodesk 123D Design,Tinkercad, 3D Tin, [Aava](http://www.amazon.com/Aava-24-Piece-Flatware-Finnish-Steel/dp/B011VFQZ9C), Blender, FreeCAD and Open SCAD.

Below is an example of a modern kitchen.
